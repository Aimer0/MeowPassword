MeowPassword is a Javascript-based password generator

### Features
-----------
- Material Deisgn
- Security (use Memory Password and Distinguish Code with MD5 algorithm to generate)
- Cross-platform (use Javascript, so you can use MeowPassword as long as you have a browser)
- Customizable password length (supports 4 to 32 lengths)
- Open source
- High Strength
- Optional special characters

### Design
-----------
- Why I create this project?

After reading Wsine's article, I browsed through the [SeekPassword](https://github.com/Wsine/seekpassword) project and found that there were some defects in the project, such as the fixed password length of 10, the insufficient password length caused by violent removal of special characters, and so on. MeowPassword came from it. (By the way, I fixed a bug for @Wsine)

### Usage

### TODO
